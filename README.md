# ENPH353_Lab4
Created a python script and GUI to find an image in a live camera feed using SIFT.
SIFT is a once state-of-the-art algorithm able to identity keypoints in an image.
By looking at correlations between keypoints in two images, we can find a smaller picture
in a larger one. Upload a picture to the GUI and display it in the camera feed, and a 
blue outline will appear around it.
